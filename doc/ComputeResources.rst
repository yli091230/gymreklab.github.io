Lab Compute Resources
=====================

We use three primary compute resources. Our local server (snorlax) is used for smaller compute jobs and every day coding, data exploration, etc. However, it has very little storage on it these days, so we recommend avoiding it for now.

TSCC and Expanse are shared compute clusters at UCSD where we run larger jobs, especially those involving large datasets that we share with UCSD collaborators. For large jobs where the data is already available on Amazon, we use Amazon Web Services.

If you're just getting started, you'll probably want to choose either TSCC or Expanse.
