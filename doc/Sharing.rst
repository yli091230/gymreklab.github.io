Sharing large files
=======

Last update: 2025/11/10

To share large files with collaborators without server access, we often use the Globus. We have a Globus path been set up on EXPNASE dbGAP folder :code:`/expanse/protected/gymreklab-dbgap/mount/H3Africa/DS_I_Africa_project`. 

To access this folder, you will need an account for EXPANSE and on the :code:`gymreklab-dbgap` group to access the EXPNASE dbGAP folder. 

Globus
---------------------

You can login Globus ID on the `website <https://app.globus.org>`_ by selecting :code: `Use your orgnizational login`. The login will redirect you to UCSD login page and make sure to choose :code:`Active Directory (MFA)` under the :code:`Or sign on with` option. Note, the defualt delection :code:`Active Directory` will not working.

Once you logged into the Globus, choose the :code:`FILE MANAGER` tab on the left panel and type in :code:`SDSC RDS HA Storage`. It may ask you to re-authenticate you identity by signing in UCSD account. If it keeps poping out :code:`no permission` error, contact :code:`support@sdsc.edu` for help.
